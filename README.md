##Project in progress

The devices logged in users pin number will be needed to programatically disable services from the device that get in the way of automated testing: Guardian, Dialogs, and Auto Sleep. These are reenabled by the script after testing is done.

Currently these settings will not turn off, but if the headset is on (tape infront of the sensor works) then it will run and be able to capture logs.
