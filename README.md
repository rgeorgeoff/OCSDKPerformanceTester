##Project in progress

The devices logged in users pin number will be needed, and passed in as an arg, to programatically disable services from the device that get in the way of automated testing: Guardian, Dialogs, and Auto Sleep. These are reenabled by the script after testing is done.

The device will need to be connected to Wifi for the pin to login and programatically disable these services.
